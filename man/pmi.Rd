\title{A function to calculate a number of information-theoretic measures on terms in a contingency table, including point-wise mutual information.}
\usage{
pmi(contingency_table, display_top_x_terms = 20, term_threshold = 5,
  every_category_counts = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{contingency_table}{A contingency table generated by the `contingency_table()` function.}

\item{display_top_x_terms}{Defaults to 20, the number of top ranked terms to display for each measure.}

\item{term_threshold}{The threshold at which terms are eliminated from the contingency table for the purposes of calculating information-theoretic quantities. THis gets around issues with terms that only appear once having very high PMI.}

\item{every_category_counts}{Defaults to FALSE, if TRUE, then terms are removed if they do not appear at least term_threshold times in every row (category) of the contingency table.}
}
\value{
A list object containing lots of different information theoretic measures calculated on the contingency table.
