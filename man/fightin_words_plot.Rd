\title{A function that generates plots similar to those in Monroe et al.
'Fightin Words...'.}
\usage{
fightin_words_plot(feature_selection_object, title = "",
  positive_category = "Category 1", negative_category = "Category 2",
  xlab = "term count", display_top_words = 20,
  display_terms_next_to_points = FALSE, size_terms_by_frequency = FALSE,
  right_margin = 20, max_terms_to_display = 1e+05,
  use_subsumed_ngrams = FALSE, limits = NULL,
  clean_publication_plots = FALSE, rank_by_log_odds = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_selection_object}{A list object generated by the
feature_selection function.}

\item{title}{A user supplied title for the plot. Defaults to "", in which
case a blank title is displayed.}

\item{positive_category}{The name the user wishes to give to the first
category specified when using the feature_selection function. Defaults to
"Category 1".}

\item{negative_category}{The name the user wishes to give to the second
category specified when using the feature_selection function. Defaults to
"Category 2".}

\item{xlab}{Defaults to 'Term Frequency', but can be modified as necessary.}

\item{display_top_words}{Defaults to 20 and controls the number of top terms
for each category displayed in the plot.}

\item{display_terms_next_to_points}{Optional argument, defaults to FALSE. If
TRUE, then terms are displayed next to the points corresponding to them on
the plot. Can get messy.}

\item{size_terms_by_frequency}{Optional argument, defualts to FALSE. If TRUE,
then when top terms are printed, they are sized in proportion to their
frequency.}

\item{right_margin}{Parameter controling how much space should be reserved
for the right margin in the plot (for displaying top terms). Defaults to 20
but can be adjusted depending on the length of terms.}

\item{max_terms_to_display}{Defaults to 100,000. Used to prevent overloading
the plotting device with very large vocabularies. Can be set by the user.}

\item{use_subsumed_ngrams}{Logical indicating whether subsumed ngrams should
be used when displaying top terms. This will only work if the user has
selected subsume_ngrams  = TRUE in the feature_selection() function (and is
using a vocabulary contianing overlapping n-grams).}

\item{limits}{An optional numeric vector of length two where the first number
is the upper x limit (term count) and the second term is the absolute value
of the maximum z-score to display (the y limit). Defaults to NULL, in which
case the optimal values are automatically determined. Can be useful for
comparison between plots.}

\item{clean_publication_plots}{Logical to remove labels inside of plot and
color all dots uniformly. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{rank_by_log_odds}{Only applicable for the "informed_Dirichlet" method.
Defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, then terms are ranked by log odds instead of z-score.}
